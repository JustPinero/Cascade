### [10.1] Queue integration for multi-project dispatch — RESOLVED 2026-04-19
`dispatchAll`, `dispatchBatch`, and `dispatchTeam` now route through the
`DispatchQueue` singleton. Option B shipped: pane grid is created upfront
with "[queued: projectname]" placeholders, and `tmux respawn-pane -k`
replaces each placeholder with the real Claude command as the queue releases
slots. Users see the full grid immediately even on low-RAM hosts; Claude
processes are gated by memory-appropriate concurrency. `dispatchTeam`'s
single lead-agent spawn takes exactly one queue slot. 3 integration tests
in `lib/claude-dispatcher.multi.test.ts` verify enqueue counts + IDs.

**Open follow-up (smaller):** dashboard UI indicator for "N running, M queued"
so users can see queue state for multi-dispatch without looking at tmux.
Not urgent — tmux "[queued]" placeholders already communicate this at the
terminal level.
